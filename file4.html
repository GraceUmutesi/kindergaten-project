        <p>“I just love the atmosphere they create at this school! My 3 year old son always comes home with creative projects and great stories from their activities everyday. I just love that he is so happy to attend and that the teachers take such great care of him! Thank you!”</p>

        <p>“I have had 3 children attend ST MARY at one time or another and my 4-year-old is currently attending pre-K. We love the teachers and the staff and have been extremely pleased with the curriculum. My son has fun every day and is excited to go.<strong> Overall, we are thrilled with <em>ST MARY!</em>”</strong></p>

        <p>“My daughter, Sydney, loves going to school every day. She has met amazing friends, and has always had the best teachers. I love when I am walking her to class and teachers who have never had her in class know exactly who she is and say hello. It's great to know that my daughter isn't just another kid that goes there, but a child that matters. Each child is treated with the same kindness.”</p>
